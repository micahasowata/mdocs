### What is software?

Software is the component of the computer that enables external input to be processable by the computer's hardware hence making it usable. It cannot be physically felt.

### Why is software important?

Software is important because it enables interactions with hardware so it is the part of the system that makes a computer a problem solving device for a vast section of people.

### Where is software important?

Software is important in any industry that performs a considerable amount of repetitive tasks that require a degree of precision on each iteration.

### What could go wrong if some software fails? List some examples.

A failure in software can lead to loss of life e.g a misdiagnosis resulting in a failure to properly generate scans or a miscalculation during the design or construction of an airplane or other means of transportation

### Where does software play an important role? List some examples.

Banking and finance has benefited hugely from software to store and process information related to customers money. Weather forecasts and communication systems also benefit from reliable software

### What are some jobs related to software development? List some.

Product managers, UI/UX designers, programmers, sales.

### Whatâ€™s the difference between computer science and programming?

Computer science is mostly theoretical and encompasses a wider array of disciplines like algorithm developement etc while programming is just the expression of ideas in code to be processed by the computer

### Where in the design, construction, and use of a ship is software used?

Software is used in all three processes. In the design, computers aid humans to arrive at precise dimensions and to iterate through ideas without using a lot of resources. In construction, robots are used in precise and hard-to-reach parts to build a ship and during use, software running in the ship regulate engine processes and communication networks

### What is a server farm?

A server farm is a large warehouse filled with high grade computers used to handle requests to sites that are frequently accessed globally.

### What kinds of queries do you ask online? List some.

- Lists of people in a specific socio-economic category

- Imaging of defective organs
- Robot assisted surgeries

### What are some uses of software in entertainment? List some.

- Screens
- Sound systems
- Broadcast networks

### What general properties do we expect from good software?

- Correctness
- Speed
- Maintainability

### What does a software developer look like?

A software developer is a good collaborator because great software is a team sport. They are also intellectual open to new and changing ideas and are willing to become acquainted with an entirely new domain knowledge if necessary to provide software that solves specific issues.

### What are the stages of software development?

- Analysis
- Design
- Programming
- Testing

The final two stages are usually bounded together as one implementation but across board feedback informs the next batch of work done on a project.

### Why can software development be difficult? List some reasons.

- Gaining a reasonable amount of domain knowledge is difficult
- Communicating with team mates of varying domain or technical knowledge or skill set
- Determining constraints to develop against

### What are some uses of software that make your life easier?

- To find information on the internet
- To maintain contact with friends

### What are some uses of software that make your life more difficult?

- For spreading misinformation
