Task:
Write an explanation (at least 100 words, but fewer than 500) of why you would like to be a computer programmer. If, on the other hand, you are convinced that you would not like to be a programmer, explain that. In either case, present well-thought-out, logical arguments.

Becoming a computer programmer is a goal of mine and has being for about 3 years now. In the past I thought I had a concrete reason why I wanted to become a programmer but thinking about this explanation has forced me to realise that I don't so I have done some inner search and come to the conclusion that it boils down to financial reward and its intellectual nature.

Compensation at top technology companies like Google rival the salaries for other traditional jobs like banking at Goldman Sachs and this makes programming a worthy alternative to the professions.

The problem solving nature is not limited to programming but it is more pronounced here and the more direct connection with mathematics is intriguing to me.
